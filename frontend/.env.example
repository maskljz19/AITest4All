# API Configuration
# ==========================================
# Development Environment:
# Use full URLs pointing to your local backend
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8000

# Production Environment:
# Use relative paths (proxied by Nginx)
# These paths will be handled by Nginx reverse proxy
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=/ws

# ==========================================
# Configuration Guide:
# 
# For local development:
# 1. Uncomment the full URL lines above
# 2. Make sure backend is running on port 8000
#
# For production deployment:
# 1. Use the relative paths (default)
# 2. Configure Nginx to proxy /api to backend
# 3. Configure Nginx to proxy /ws to backend WebSocket
